We have already covered ERD modeling, and SQL, two fundamental requirements for designing a database.
Now that we have the database, it's time to learn how to write application programs that interact with database. 

In the previous class we discuss a python program that connects to the database and executes query. 
Python and MySQL can be useful combination for developing a desktop application. 
However most database applications developed nowadays are web based.
Which means clients send their requests using the browser, server listen to the requests and return results that are displayed on the browser.

We will use PHP for writing a set of scripts in order to develop a web application that will interact with a MySQL database.
For this we first need to have following software installed on our system.

1. A web server (e.g. IIS, Apache etc)
2. Server side programming language (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP)
3. A database Server (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL)

Since most students use Microsoft Windows (7, 8 or 10), we can install a complete stack containing all required software for writing a web application. 
WAMP(Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is suitable for our need. 
To download and install WAMP use this link [http://www.wampserver.com/en/].

If you have MySQL already installed on your system, un-install it before installing WAMP.
