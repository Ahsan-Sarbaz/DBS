1. database is a collection of related data
2. database management system (DBMS) is a software that manages and controls access
to the database.
3. database application is a program that interacts with the database at some point in its execution.

You interact with a database when:
1. purchasing goods from supermarket
2. purchasing goods using credit card.
3. borrowing book from a library
4. using internet


Traditional File-Based Systems:
Why do we need to know about file-based systems?
1. Understanding their problems may prevent us from repeating these problems in database systems
2. Such knowledge is extremely useful when converting an existing file-based system to database system.

What is file-based system?
It is a collection of programs, where each program define and manages its own data.

When file-based system breaks down?
It breaks down when we have to cross reference large amounts of data stored in hundreds of files.

Drawbacks/ Limitations of File-Based approach:
1. Separation and Isolation of data.
2. Duplication of data.
3. Program Data dependence: physical structure and storage of data files and record are defined in application code.
4. Incompatible file formats.
5. No facility for asking unplanned queries. 
6. No provision for security or integrity.
7. No existence of recovery in case of hardware or software failure
8. No provision for shared access to files.

Formal definition of Database:
A shared collection of logically related data and its description, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.

Description of the data is known as system catalog, or data dictionary or meta data.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
